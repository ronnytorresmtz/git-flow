<b> Successful Git Branching Model By Vincent Driessen </b> [more](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) [PDF](https://github.com/ronnytorresmtz/git-flow/blob/master/Git-branching-model.pdf)
- master branch 
- develp branch
- Feature branches
- Release branches
- Hotfix branches

## Master Branch
### Create Repository

- Create a new repository 
```
Login to GitHub and Create a Repository WIThOUT the readme file

For example: ronnytorresmtz/{test}

```

- Link remote (local directory) to origin repository

```
git init
echo "# comments" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/ronnytorresmtz/{test}.git
git push -u origin master
```
- Push an existing repository from the command line
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/ronnytorresmtz/{test}.git
git push -u origin master
```
- List all branches (local and remotes)
```
git branch -a
```
- Set password and email
```
git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"
git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"
```
## Develop Branch
### Create Develop Branch
- Create a new branch, named develop and switch to develop branch
```
git checkout -b develop
```
- Change to master branch
```
git checkout master
```
### Commit Changes and Push to Branch
- Add all file to stage
```
git add .
```
- Commit changes for the file in stage with a commit description
```
git commit -m "first commit"
```
- Push our changes to our remote repository
```
git push
```
### Merge Develop Branch to Master Branch
- Merge the changes from the develop branch to the master branch
```
git checkout master
git branch (== to be sure we are in master branch ==)
git merge develop --no-ff (== without losing the develop branch history ==)
```
## Feature Branch
### Creating a feature 
- Creating a feature branch from develop branch and switch to feature branch
```
git checkout -b myfeature develop
```
- Finished feature 
- Merge feature to develop
```
git checkout develop (== Switched to branch 'develop' ==)
git merge --no-ff myfeature (== (Summary of changes ==)
git push origin develop (== Push local to remote develop branch ==)

git branch -d myfeature (== Deleted local branch myfeature ==)
git push origin --delete myfeature (==Delete remote branch myfeature==)
```
## Release Branch
### Creating a release branch
- Creating a release branch with a tag number
```
git checkout -b release-1.2 develop (== Switched to a new branch "release-1.2" ==)
$ ./bump-version.sh 1.2 (== changes some files in the working copy to reflect the new version ==)
$ git commit -a -m "Bumped version number to 1.2"
```
### Finishing a release branch

- Mmerge release to master
```
git checkout master (== Switched to branch 'master' ==)
git merge --no-ff release-1.2 (== Merge release to master)
git tag -a 1.2 (== set master with 1.2 tag ==)
```
- Merge relese to develop
```
git checkout develop (== Switched to branch 'develop'==)
git merge --no-ff release-1.2 (== Merge release to develop without lossing the history==)
git branch -d release-1.2 (== Deleted branch release-1.2==)
```
## Hotfix Branch
### Creating the hotfix branch 
- Creating the hotfix branch and switch to hotfix branch
```
git checkout -b hotfix-1.2.1 master (== Switched to a new branch "hotfix-1.2.1" ==)
./bump-version.sh 1.2.1  (== changes some files in the working copy to reflect the new version ==)
git commit -a -m "Bumped version number to 1.2.1"
git commit -m "Fixed severe production problem"
```
### Finishing a hotfix branch
- Update master and tag the release on master
```
git checkout master (== Switched to branch 'master' ==)
git merge --no-ff hotfix-1.2.1 (== Merge release to master)
git tag -a 1.2.1 (== set master with 1.2 tag ==)
```
- Update the bugfix in develop
```
git checkout develop (== Switched to branch 'develop'==)
git merge --no-ff hotfix-1.2.1 (== Merge to develop)
```
- Remove the temporary branch
```
git branch -d hotfix-1.2.1 (delete the hotfix branch)
```

# Delete Repository (DANGER!!!)
- Remove local repository
```
git branch -d branch_name
With Capital -D force the deletion even if it is not merge
```

- Remove Remote repository
```
git push --delete origin branch_name
```
